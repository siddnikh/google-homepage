# google-homepage
Done as a project while following "The Odin Project". 
Took me a few hours and a lot of frustration that went through, but I'm happy with what I ended up with. The Odin Project is great for this purpose of learning Web Development, and I recommend it to everyone.
The task was to make a replica/lookalike of the Google Search Engine Homepage. 
The Google Homepage looks like this: 
![Google Homepage](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Google_web_search.png)

I tried to replicate it in every manner except I used a different favicon cause... I wanted to.
